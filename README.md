[*Textometrica*](https://web.archive.org/web/20120201063603/http://textometrica.humlab.umu.se/) was an application for combining quantitative content analysis, qualitative thematization, and network analysis, originally conceived by me, Simon Lindgren, and coded in PHP by Fredrik Palm at Humlab, Umeå University, in 2011.

This app, coded in Python by [Simon Lindgren](https://github.com/simonlindgren), makes the Textometrica workflow available anew.
